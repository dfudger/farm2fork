        =========
        
        A git repository for team 3 in the course cis3750
        
        Everyone has their own fork. There is nothing preventing you from messing with
        someone branch but don't do it. It's mean.

        ## Development
        Follow this quick guide to get the project setup on your computer so you can start development.
        
        I don't know If this will work for macs but if not let me know if it does not and we can tweak it. 
        
        #### Set up a virtual environment
        
        You will want to have a virtual environment so that you don't screw up your
        computer's python installation
        
            $  sudo easy_install virtualenv
            $  virtualenv --no-site-packages f2fenv
        
        #### Install pyramid in the environment
        
            $  cd f2fenv
            $  bin/easy_install pyramid
        
        #### Clone the repo (repository) into your virtual env 
        
        from within your virtual environment.
        
            $  git clone git@github.com:hockeybuggy/farm2fork.git
        
        #### Install up the pyramid project for development
        
            $  cd farm2fork
            $  ../bin/python setup.py develop
        
        #### Run the projects tests to make sure it's all ok
        
        from within the farm2form repo.
        
            $  cd farm2fork_otmd
            $  ../bin/python setup.py test
            >  ...
            >  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
            >  Ran 2 tests in 0.006s
            >  
            >  OK
        
        #### Run the server locally
        
            $  ../bin/pserve development.ini
            >  Starting server in PID 3479.
            >  serving on http://0.0.0.0:6543
        
        That should be about it. You will find the majority of the project files that
        we will be working on is in the subdirectory also called farm2fork_otmd.
        
        When I am working on this I have one terminal that I use for running the server
        and one that I use for running tests and the like. But do whatever works for
        you.
